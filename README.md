    Back in the day, I was totally clueless about coding in elementary school. Why bother with all those fancy lines just to say "hello world" when copy-pasting got the job done? But hey, times change! I've gone from mindlessly memorizing code to actually getting what's going on. Coding went from boring to a cool adventure. And screens? They used to be just for games, but now they're like portals to endless possibilities! Talk about a glow-up, right?<br><br>
    From mastering Python, Java, C, to tinkering with Internet of things or web development languages like NodeJS, I'm constantly honing my skills to push boundaries and innovate. Whether I'm crunching numbers with machine learning algorithms or crafting a <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/t36TyZs9H4g?si=kJ3ZES4msUqVkwO6">self parking car</a>, I'm fueled by a passion for problem-solving and a thirst for knowledge. Beyond the keyboard, you'll find me exploring the intricacies of psychology, hitting the gym for a solid workout, or engaging in spirited debates. Let's team up and bring some serious magic to the table!
